# OOP Draw

We will be following a tutorial on OOP which will be walking you through a typical life cycle of an app - using a framework, creating a GUI, implementing related objects, building on code that you receive from someone else, testing it out. 

The tutorial is available on this repo as a PDF. 

As is familiar by now: 

- clone this repo 
- create your solution inside that local folder 
- commit, push and sync frequently 

But, new in this assignment: 

- also answer the questions from the doc in the EAD that is on the Google Classroom assignment.
